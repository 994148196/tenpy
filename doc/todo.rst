To-Do list
==========
Update doc/changes_TenPy.rst if you've done something.

Primary goals for the coming release
------------------------------------
- finish documentation and tests on existing stuff


Concrete things to be fixed in different files
----------------------------------------------
- The MPO class has no function for expectation value with MPS


To be done at some point for the next releases
----------------------------------------------
- documentation on the idea of algorithms, references in doc strings.

  - overview and usage introduction to the overall library
  - np_conserved needs an introduction for newbies
  - usage introduction with very simple (few-line) examples for newbies.

- functionality to remove charges from an MPS, 
  e.g. if we use DMRG with charge conservation and want to quench and time evolve 
  with a different hamiltonian violating some charge conservation...
  Should be possible using Site.perm correctly...


Wish-list
---------
- Open Source on GitHub? -> Licence? Documentation on readthedocs.org?
- logging mechanism?
- Johannes Motruk: extend simulation class: save standard variables like entropy, energy, etc?
- Ruben: extend MPS TransferMatrix class

Auto-generated To-Do list

Here, you can report Bugs that need to be fixed.


Known limitations
-----------------
TenPyLight is meant to be a simple and readably library. Therefore, it may not handle every special case correctly.
Here, we collect a list of some known 'bugs' that won't be fixed (at least not in the near future).
