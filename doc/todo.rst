To-Do list
==========
Update doc/changes_TenPy.rst if you've done something.

Primary goals for the coming release
------------------------------------
- finish documentation and tests on existing stuff
- Make it OpenSource :)


Concrete things to be fixed in different files
----------------------------------------------
- The MPO class has no function for expectation value with MPS
- Since we switched to python 3 completely, there's no need to subclass 'object' anymore.
- npc.Array: comparison with ==, pickle, hashable?
- MPS class: canonical_form for infinite bc!
- MPS class: group_sites, split_sites, pad
- MPS class: probability_per_charge, charge_variance
- MPS class: string correlation function
- MPS class: pollmann_turner


To be done at some point for the next releases
----------------------------------------------
- documentation on the idea of algorithms, references in doc strings.

  - overview and usage introduction to the overall library
  - np_conserved needs an introduction for newbies
  - usage introduction with very simple (few-line) examples for newbies.

- functionality to remove charges from an MPS, 
  e.g. if we use DMRG with charge conservation and want to quench and time evolve 
  with a different hamiltonian violating some charge conservation...
  Should be possible using Site.perm correctly...
- suggest installing nose2 instead of nose, change compatibility as needed. Like numpy: tests directly in tenpy tree?
- trace: allow multiple axes to be traced over; optimize


Wish-list
---------
- Open Source on GitHub? -> Licence? Documentation on readthedocs.org?
- logging mechanism?
- Johannes Motruk: extend simulation class: save standard variables like entropy, energy, etc?
- Ruben: extend MPS TransferMatrix class
- Jakob: function for Arrays: Perfrom trace over multiple pairs of legs at once. Tracing one after the other calculates unnecessary "off-diagonal" elements.

Auto-generated To-Do list
-------------------------
The following list is auto-generated by sphinx, extracting ``.. todo ::`` blocks from doc-strings of the code.

BUGS
====
Here, you can report Bugs that need to be fixed.


Known limitations
-----------------
TenPyLight is meant to be a simple and readably library. Therefore, it may not handle every special case correctly.
Here, we collect a list of some known 'bugs' that won't be fixed (at least not in the near future).
