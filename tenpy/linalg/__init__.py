r"""Linear-algebra tools for tensor networks.

Most notably is the module :mod:`~tenpy.linalg.np_conserved`,
which contains everything needed to make use of
charge conservervation in the context of tensor networks.

Relevant contenents of :mod:`~tenpy.linalg.charges`
are imported to :mod:`~tenpy.linalg.np_conserved`,
so you propably won't need to import `charges` directly.
