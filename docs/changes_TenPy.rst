Changes compared to previous TenPy
==================================

Global changes
--------------
- syntax style based on PEP8. Use ``$>yapf -r -i ./`` to ensure consitent formatting over the whole project.
  Special comments ``# yapf: disable`` and ``# yapf: enable`` can be used for manual formatting of some regions in code.
- all modules are in the folder ``tenpy`` to avoid name conflicts with other libraries.
- withing the library, relative imports are used, e.g., ``from ..tools.math import (toiterable, tonparray)``
  Exception: the files in `tests/` and `examples/` run as ``__main__`` and can't use relative imports

  Files outside of the library (and in `tests/`, `examples/`) should use
  absolute imports , e.g., ``import tenpy.algorithms.tebd``


np_conserved
------------
- pure python, no more compiling required!
- in module :mod:`tenpy.linalg` instead of ``algorithms/linalg``.
- moved functionality for charges to :mod:`~tenpy.linalg.charges`
- Introduced the classes :class:`~tenpy.linalg.charges.ChargeInfo` (basically the old ``q_number``, and ``mod_q``)
  and :class:`~tenpy.linalg.charges.LegCharge` (the old ``qind, qconj``).
- Introduced the class :class:`~tenpy.linalg.charges.LegPipe` to replace the old ``leg_pipe``.
It is derived from ``LegCharge`` and used as a leg in the `array` class. Thus any inherited array (after
``tensordot`` etc still has all the necessary information to split the legs.
(The legs are shared between different arrays, so it's saved only once in memory)


tools
-----
- added :mod:`tenpy.tools.misc`, which contains 'random stuff' from old ``tools.math``
  like ``to_iterable`` and ``to_array`` (renamed to follow PEP8, and documented)
